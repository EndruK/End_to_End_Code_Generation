# End_to_End_Code_Generation
The goal of this projects is to be able to generate code snippets in Python from natural language decriptions following an End-to-End approach (parallel text corpora: intentions (NL) Vs. Snippets (Python)).

## Dataset

https://conala-corpus.github.io/

Code/Natural Language Challenge, a joint project of the Carnegie Mellon University NeuLab and STRUDEL Lab! This challenge was designed to test systems for generating program snippets from natural language. For example, if the input is:

> sort list x in reverse order, then the system would be required to output x.sort(reverse=True) in Python.

## Framework
Tensorflow - Keras

## Description

  - Same implementation as Machine Translation. I am considering sequences of words and not of single characters.
